# MAGIC # COMP.CS.320 Data-Intensive Programming, Exercise 4
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This exercise is in three parts.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Tasks 1-4 are basic tasks of using RDDs with text based data.
# MAGIC - Tasks 5-7 are similar basic tasks for text data but using DataFrames instead.
# MAGIC - Task 8 is a theory question related to the lectures.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is the **Python** version, switch to the Scala version if you want to do the tasks in Scala.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each task has its own cell(s) for the code. Add your solutions to the cells. You are free to add more cells if you feel it is necessary.<br>
# MAGIC There are cells with test code and example output following most of the tasks that involve producing code.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC At the end of the notebook, there is a question regarding the use of AI or other collaboration when working the tasks.<br>
# MAGIC Please remember to answer the AI question. And finally, don't forget to submit your solutions to Moodle: [Weekly Exercise #4](https://moodle.tuni.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=3503819)

# MAGIC ## Task 2 - Counting the number of words
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using the RDD from task 1 as a starting point:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Create `wordsRdd` where each row contains one word with the following rules for words:
# MAGIC     - The word must have at least one character.
# MAGIC     - The word must not contain any numbers, i.e. the digits 0-9.
# MAGIC - Calculate the total number of words in the article collection using `wordsRDD`.
# MAGIC - Calculate the total number of distinct words in the article collection using the same criteria for the words.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can assume that words in the same line are separated from each other in the article collection by whitespace characters (` `).<br>
# MAGIC In this exercise you can ignore capitalization, parenthesis, and punctuation characters. I.e., `word`, `Word`, `WORD`, `word.`, `(word)`, and `word).` should all be considered as valid and distinct words for this exercise.

# COMMAND ----------

wordsRDD: RDD[str] = ???

numberOfWords: float = ???

# MAGIC The total number of distinct words not containing digits: 9463
# MAGIC ```

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 3 - Counting word occurrences with RDD
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Using the article collection data, create a pair RDD, `wordCountRDD`, where each row contains a distinct word and the count for how many times the word can be found in the collection.
# MAGIC     - Use the same word criteria as in task 2, i.e., ignore words which contain digits.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Using the created pair RDD, find what is the most common 8-letter word that is not `software` and starts with an `s`, and what is its count in the collection.
# MAGIC     - You can modify the given code and find the word and its count separately if that seems easier for you.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"First row in wordCountRDD: word: '{wordCountRDD.first()[0]}', count: {wordCountRDD.first()[1]}")
print(f"The most common 8-letter word that is not 'software' and starts with 's': '{askedWord}' (appears {wordCount} times)")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```text
# MAGIC First row in wordCountRDD: word: 'sense,', count: 1
# MAGIC The most common 8-letter word that is not 'software' and starts with 's': 'specific' (appears 41 times)

# MAGIC ## Task 4 - Digit occurrences in text
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using the article collection data, create a pair RDD, `digitsRDD`, where each row contains digits from 0 to 9, and the average number of times each digit appears in a line in the source data. Order the RDD such that the most common digit is given first.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As before, ignore all those lines that are empty in the article collection in this task.

# MAGIC ## Task 5 - Handling text data with DataFrames
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this task the same Wikipedia article collection as in the RDD tasks 1-4 is used.<br>
# MAGIC In the [Shared container](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Storage/ContainerMenuBlade/~/overview/storageAccountId/%2Fsubscriptions%2Fe0c78478-e7f8-429c-a25f-015eae9f54bb%2FresourceGroups%2Ftuni-cs320-f2025-rg%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Storage%2FstorageAccounts%2Ftunics320f2025gen2/path/shared/etag/%220x8DE01A3A1A66C90%22/defaultId//publicAccessVal/None) the folder `exercises/ex4/wiki` contains the texts from selected Wikipedia articles in raw text format.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Scala supports Datasets, which are typed DataFrames, and the corresponding Scala task is about using them instead of RDDs to redo tasks 1 and 2.<br>
# MAGIC The Datasets are not supported by pyspark, thus this Python task is about using DataFrames instead.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Part 1:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Do task 1 again, but this time using the higher level `DataFrame` instead of the low level `RDD`.
# MAGIC     - Load all articles into a single `DataFrame`. Exclude all empty lines from the DataFrame.
# MAGIC     - Count the total number of non-empty lines in the article collection.
# MAGIC     - Pick the first 7 lines from the created DataFrame and print them out.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Part 2:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Do task 2 again, but this time using the higher level `DataFrame` instead of the low level `RDD`.
# MAGIC - Using the DataFrame from first part of this task as a starting point:
# MAGIC     - Create `wordsDF` where each row contains one word with the following rules for words:
# MAGIC         - The word must have at least one character.
# MAGIC         - The word must not contain any numbers, i.e. the digits 0-9.
# MAGIC     - Calculate the total number of words in the article collection using `wordsDF`.
# MAGIC     - Calculate the total number of distinct words in the article collection using the same criteria for the words.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can assume that words in the same line are separated from each other in the article collection by whitespace characters (` `).<br>
# MAGIC In this exercise you can ignore capitalization, parenthesis, and punctuation characters. I.e., `word`, `Word`, `word.`, and `(word)` should all be considered as valid and distinct words for this exercise.

# MAGIC ## Task 6 - Counting word occurrences with DataFrame
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Do task 3 again, but this time using the higher level `DataFrame` instead of the low level `RDD`.<br>
# MAGIC Also, this time you should use the given data class `WordCount` for the final result instead of `(str, int)` tuple like in task 3 with the RDD.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Using the article collection data, create a `DataFrame`, `wordCountDF`, where each row contains a distinct word and the count for how many times the word can be found in the collection.
# MAGIC     - Use the same word criteria as in task 2, i.e., ignore words which contain digits.
# MAGIC     - Have the column names in the DataFrame match the data class `WordCount`, i.e., `word` and `count`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Using the created DataFrame, find what is the most common 8-letter word that is not `software` and starts with an `s`, and what is its count in the collection.
# MAGIC     - The straightforward way is to determine the word and its count together. However, you can determine the word and its count separately if you want.
# MAGIC     - Give the final result as an instance of the data class.

# MAGIC ## Task 8 - Theory question
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using your own words, answer the following questions:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. DataFrames, RDDs, and Datasets all have operations that can be divided into transformations and actions.
# MAGIC    - How would you describe transformations? And how would you describe actions?
# MAGIC    - How do actions differ from transformations?
# MAGIC    - Give some examples on both types of operations.
# MAGIC 2. Lazy evaluation was mentioned in the lectures.
# MAGIC     - What does lazy evaluation mean? How does it differ compared to eager evaluation?
# MAGIC     - Why is understanding lazy evaluation important when using Spark?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Extensive answers are not required here.<br>

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using AI and collaborating with other students is allowed when doing the weekly exercises.<br>
# MAGIC However, the AI use and collaboration should be documented.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Did you use AI tools while doing this exercise?
# MAGIC   - Did they help? And how did they help?
