# MAGIC # COMP.CS.320 Data-Intensive Programming, Exercise 1
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This exercise is mostly introduction to the Azure Databricks notebook system.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are some basic programming tasks that can be done in either Scala or Python. The Spark related tasks start next week in exercise 2.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is the **Python** version, switch to the Scala version if you want to do the tasks in Scala.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each task has its own cell(s) for the code. Add your solutions to the cells. You are free to add more cells if you feel it is necessary.<br>
# MAGIC There are cells with test code and example output following most of the tasks that involve producing code.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC At the end of the notebook, there is a question regarding the use of AI or other collaboration when working the tasks.<br>
# MAGIC Please remember to answer the AI question. And finally, don't forget to submit your solutions to Moodle: [Weekly Exercise #1](https://moodle.tuni.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=3503816)

# MAGIC ## Task 5 - Grouping and aggregating
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You are given a list of tuples representing sensor readings (`temperatureReadings`). Each tuple contains a sensor name and a temperature reading.<br>
# MAGIC You are also given a function `average` that returns the average value of the given list.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Part 1:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Using the given readings and the `average` function, calculate the average temperature reading for each sensor and assign them as a dictionary to `averageTemperatures`.<br>
# MAGIC Any working solution is accepted, but you are encouraged to try to solve this using `groupby` function from itertools.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Part 2:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Find the value for the highest average temperature.

# COMMAND ----------

from functools import reduce
from itertools import groupby  # itertools.groupby requires the list to be sorted

temperatureReadings: list[tuple[str, float]] = [
    ("sensorA", 19.4),
    ("sensorB", 19.0),
    ("sensorA", 20.1),
    ("sensorC", 18.6),
    ("sensorC", 18.7),
    ("sensorB", 20.5),
    ("sensorC", 18.3),
    ("sensorA", 18.3),
    ("sensorA", 21.0),
    ("sensorB", 21.1),
    ("sensorC", 19.2),
    ("sensorB", 19.8),
]

def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    value_sum, value_count = reduce(
        lambda pair, elem: (pair[0] + elem, pair[1] + 1), values, (0.0, 0)
    )
    return value_sum / value_count


# A map for the average temperatures for each sensor

# MAGIC ## Task 6 - Code explanation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Look at the `average` function that was given in task 5.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If you are not used to functional programming, it might look quite strange and somewhat different than the way you would "traditionally" write a function that calculates the average from a list of numbers (when doing so without using any built-in functionalities of the programming language).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Explain in your own words how the `average` function works.
# MAGIC - Are there any benefits to this implementation compared to a straightforward implementation that separately calculates the sum and the count of the elements?
# MAGIC - What happens with this implementation if the input is an empty list? Given your solution to task 5, can this cause issues?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The `average` function uses the `reduce` function to iterate through the list of values. It calculates both the sum and the count in a tuple. For each element, it adds the element to the sum and increments the count by one. It divides the total sum by the count to compute the average after processing all elements.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Benefits of this implementation:
# MAGIC - It does the calculation of sum and count at one go, it can be more efficient for very large lists.
# MAGIC - It shows a functional programming style which looks and feels more concise.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Issues:
# MAGIC - If the input list is empty, the count will be zero, so it will raise an exception when calculating the average (division by zero).
# MAGIC - If an empty list is passed to the function, this will cause an error and may interrupt the program. We should handle the empty list case explicitly.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 7 - Approximation for seventh root
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write a function, `seventhRoot`, that returns an approximate value for the seventh root of the input.<br>
# MAGIC Use the Newton's method, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), with the initial guess of 1. For the seventh root this Newton's method translates to:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC $$y_0 = 1$$
# MAGIC $$y_{n+1} = \frac{1}{7}\bigg(6y_n + \frac{x}{y_n^6}\bigg) $$
# MAGIC
# MAGIC where `x` is the input value and `y_n` is the guess for the cube root after `n` iterations. For large enough `k`, $$y_k \approx \sqrt[7]{x} $$
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Example steps when `x=128`:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC $$y_0 = 1$$
# MAGIC $$y_1 = \frac{1}{7}\big(6*1 + \frac{128}{1^6}\big) \approx 19.143$$
# MAGIC
# MAGIC $$y_2 \approx \frac{1}{7}\big(6*19.143 + \frac{128}{19.143^6}\big) \approx 16.408$$
# MAGIC
# MAGIC $$y_3 \approx \frac{1}{7}\big(6*16.408 + \frac{128}{16.408^6}\big) \approx 14.064$$
# MAGIC
# MAGIC $$...$$
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You will have to decide yourself on what is the condition for stopping the iterations. (you can add parameters to the function if you think it is necessary)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note, if your code is running for hundreds or thousands of iterations, you are either doing something wrong or trying to calculate too precise values.<br>
# MAGIC The example output has been calculated using less than 100 iterations in each case.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Task 8 - General programming background question
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For the final task of the first exercise, just answer the following questions:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. What king of programming background do you have? (for example, how many courses have you taken or how many years of experience do you have)
# MAGIC 2. How did you find the use of the Databricks environment and the notebooks?
# MAGIC 3. How did you find these programming tasks? (easy, hard, interesting, annoying, ...)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are no correct answers to this task.<br>
# MAGIC The answers might give the course staff a better understanding on level of the programming skills the students have.<br>
# MAGIC Short answers are accepted, but you are free to write any constructive comments you can think of.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. I worked as a software engineer for the last 4 years before joining TAU for masters. I was mostly using Java for day to day work. Projects spanning from ERP, meal management systems, and laboratory chemical management etc.
# MAGIC 2. I am using Azure Databricks for the first time, and it's really convenient and easy to start with, without setting up the local environment, although I have set everything up locally. I am actually loving this environment for its portability and convenience.
# MAGIC 3. The tasks were interesting, I would say.

# MAGIC ## Use of AI and collaboration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using AI and collaborating with other students is allowed when doing the weekly exercises.<br>
# MAGIC However, the AI use and collaboration should be documented.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Did you use AI tools while doing this exercise?
# MAGIC   - Did they help? And how did they help?
# MAGIC - Did you work with other students to complete the tasks?
# MAGIC   - Only extensive collaboration is expected to be reported. If you only got help for a couple of the tasks, you don't need to report it here.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - I used the AI tools for some things here and there, mainly with some algorithms and pseudo codes, and also for syntax sometimes. After all the years in programming, it's still challenging to remember every syntax by heart.
# MAGIC - No, I worked on it on my own, just me and my machine.
